Visualize mathematical functions in 2D coordinate system

This small application draws the most common mathematical functions in a coordinate system. You can change the colors and spacing of the coordinate system. This can be used to illustrate what the sine and cosine functions, for example, look like in relation to each other.The program is still unfinished. I have not yet implemented the way an arbitrary function is represented in the coordinate system.

he program is written in C ++ using Microsoft Foundation Class libraries. The program can be compiled with the Visual Studio 2019 IDE.
